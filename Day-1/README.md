### HTML and CSS Project Folder Structure

#### Folder Structure

```
project-root/
│
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── images/
│   └── example.jpg
├── js/
│   └── scripts.js
└── README.md
```

#### Explanation of Each Part

1. **`index.html`**: The main HTML file of your project.
2. **`css/`**: Directory for all CSS files.
   - **`styles.css`**: Main CSS file.
3. **`images/`**: Directory for images used in your project.
4. **`js/`**: Directory for JavaScript files (optional if you're only working with HTML and CSS initially).
   - **`scripts.js`**: Main JavaScript file.
5. **`README.md`**: A markdown file to describe your project, how to set it up, and any other relevant information.

#### Best Practices

1. **Use Clear and Consistent Naming Conventions**:
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens for file and folder names (`styles.css`, `index.html`).
   
2. **Organize by Type**:
   - Group files by their type (e.g., CSS files in the `css/` folder, images in the `images/` folder).
   
3. **Separate Concerns**:
   - Keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files separate to maintain a clear structure.
   
4. **README File**:
   - Include a `README.md` file to provide an overview of the project, setup instructions, and any other relevant information.
